# Screeps Kingdom AI

Welcome to **Screeps Kingdom AI** â€“ a fresh codebase focused on building a scalable, maintainable and competitive empire in the MMO programming game [Screeps](https://screeps.com/).

## 1. Vision & Goals

Our objective is to create an autonomous AI that:

* **Grows steadily** from a single room to a multi-shard kingdom.
* **Adapts** its economy, expansion and military tactics to changing game states.
* **Self-maintains** through clean, modular code supported by tests and continuous integration.
* **Learns** from in-game metrics and evolves its strategies over time.

## 2. High-Level Strategy

The AI follows a staged approach inspired by proven Screeps patterns and the official [Screeps API](https://docs.screeps.com/api/):

| Phase | Focus | Key Milestones |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Bootstrapping** | Establish a sustainable energy economy at RCL 2-3. | â€¢ Harvest & store â‰¥ 300 energy/tick<br>â€¢ Keep **Spawn** energy â‰¥ 200 at all times |
| **Growth** | Rapid Room Controller upgrading & infrastructure build-out. | â€¢ Maintain â‰¤ 5 ticks downtime on `StructureSpawn.spawnCreep`<br>â€¢ Complete extensions, roads, defensive walls |
| **Multi-room** | Claim adjacent rooms and balance logistics. | â€¢ Automated remote mining<br>â€¢ Reserve/claim at cost â‰¤ 1 CPU/tick per room |
| **Defense & PvP** | Harden borders then project power. | â€¢ Tower automation & rampart layout<br>â€¢ Adaptive combat creep compositions |
| **Market & Power** | Optimize credits, pixels, GPL. | â€¢ Arbitrage orders â‰¥ 5% margin<br>â€¢ Enable `PowerSpawn` & power harvesting |

> NOTE: Exact thresholds are iterated via telemetry once we reach each stage.

## 3. Technical Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  loop(Main) --> tick("Game\ntime loop")
  tick -->|Gather state| memory[Memory\n& Cache]
  memory --> planner[High-level Planner]
  planner --> spawns[Spawn Manager]
  planner --> jobs[Job Queue]
  jobs --> workers[Role Executors]
  workers -->|Act using Creep API| world[(Room / World)]
  world --> loop
```

Key modules:

* **Role Executors** â€“ Small, single-responsibility classes implementing individual creep behaviors (e.g., Harvester, Builder, Defender). Their core method is `run(creep: Creep)`.
* **Spawn Manager** â€“ Centralizes `StructureSpawn.spawnCreep(body, name, opts)` decisions based on current demand, energy and `Game.spawns` status.
* **Planner** â€“ Global brain that evaluates metrics (GCL, energy flow, threats) and assigns high-level intents each tick.
* **Memory Schema** â€“ `Memory` typings stored under `src/types.d.ts` for IntelliSense & compile-time safety.

Coding standards:

* TypeScript strict mode (`"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`).
* ESLint + Prettier to enforce style and catch errors early.
* Unit tests with Jest for deterministic logic (pathfinding, body selection, planners).

## 4. Development Workflow

This project follows a **standard GitHub flow**: feature branches âžœ pull requests âžœ continuous integration âžœ merge.

1. **Fork & Clone** â€“ Fork the repository on GitHub and `git clone` your fork locally.
2. **Create a Branch** â€“ `git checkout -b feature/awesome-change`.
3. **Code & Test** â€“ Implement your changes and run Jest unit tests.
4. **Simulate** â€“ Spin up the local Screeps server (`npm run sim`) to verify behaviour in-game.
5. **Lint & Build** â€“ `npm run lint && npm run build` to ensure the bundle compiles and style rules pass.
6. **Push & Open a PR** â€“ `git push -u origin feature/awesome-change` then open a pull request on GitHub.
7. **CI & Review** â€“ Wait for GitHub Actions to pass, request review, and merge into `main` once approved.
8. **Deploy to Screeps** â€“ After merging, run `npm run push` (or `grunt screeps`) to upload the compiled `dist/*.js` to the configured Screeps branch using your auth token. See the [official docs](https://docs.screeps.com/commit.html) for details.

Project scripts (defined in `package.json`):

* `build` â€“ Compile TypeScript and bundle with Rollup.
* `lint` â€“ ESLint with TypeScript support and Screeps globals.
* `test` â€“ Jest unit tests with TypeScript support.
* `watch` â€“ Watch mode for continuous compilation during development.
* `format` â€“ Prettier code formatting.
* `push` â€“ Upload compiled code to Screeps using screeps-api.

## 5. Getting Started

```bash
# 0. Fork & clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/screeps-kingdom-ai.git
cd screeps-kingdom-ai

# 1. Install Node.js 16 (recommended)
# Using nvm (recommended):
nvm install 16
nvm use 16

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Initialize the local Screeps server
npm run sim:init

# 4. Start the local server
npm run sim

# 5. Build your AI bundle
npm run build

# 6. Upload the bundle to Screeps (online shard)
npm run push   # uses SCREEPS_TOKEN & SCREEPS_BRANCH from .env

# 7. Run tests and linting
npm test
npm run lint
```

### Local Development

This project is configured to use the official `screeps` package for local development, which provides a command-line interface to run a private server. Ensure you are using Node.js v16, as specified in the `.nvmrc` file.

Your local client will look for scripts in:
`"/Users/philippetillheden/Library/Application Support/Screeps/scripts/0_0_0_0___21025/default"`

You can build and copy the script automatically by running:
`npm run build:deploy`

### Debugging

The AI includes a built-in logger with multiple verbosity levels. You can control the log output from the in-game console by setting `Memory.logLevel`.

*   `Memory.logLevel = 0` (DEBUG): Shows all messages, including profiler data.
*   `Memory.logLevel = 1` (INFO): The default level; shows standard events like spawning.
*   `Memory.logLevel = 2` (WARN): Shows warnings.
*   `Memory.logLevel = 3` (ERROR): Shows only errors.
