# Implementation Plan – Screeps Kingdom AI

> "A goal without a plan is just a wish." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

This document breaks down **every major step** required to evolve this codebase from an empty repository into a resilient, multi-shard empire.  Each phase contains:

* Objectives – the high-level purpose of the phase.
* Prerequisites – what must already be true before starting.
* Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) – ordered tasks and sub-tasks.
* Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria – how we know we're done.
* Metrics / Telemetry – quantitative targets to measure success.

Estimated timelines assume ~5–8 focused hours per week by a solo developer.  Adjust as capacity changes.

## Phase 0 – Local Environment Setup

### Objectives
1. Establish a frictionless local dev workflow.
2. Ensure local build, lint and test commands run reliably.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js v16 installed.
* Screeps account + API token ready.

> **Status: Completed**
>
> **Retrospective:**
> The environment setup was successful. We established a robust workflow using TypeScript, Rollup for bundling, ESLint/Prettier for code quality, and a local Screeps server for rapid testing. A key deliverable was the `Logger` utility, which allows for adjustable log verbosity via `Memory.logLevel`, crucial for debugging without impacting live server CPU. The core build, lint, and test scripts are functional.

### Work Breakdown Structure
1. **Repo Bootstrapping**
   1. Initialize Git repository, commit `README.md` & license, then create and push to a GitHub repository.
   2. Configure `.gitignore` for `dist/`, `node_modules/`, secrets.
2. **Package Management**
   1. Run `npm init -y` → baseline `package.json`.
   2. Add `typescript`, `ts-node`, `@types/screeps`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `jest`, `ts-jest`, `husky`, `lint-staged`.
3. **TypeScript Setup**
   1. Generate `tsconfig.json` with `"strict": true` and `es2021` target.
   2. Create `src/` folder and placeholder `main.ts` with empty game loop.
4. **Build & Bundle**
   1. Install `rollup` and its TypeScript/CommonJS plugins (`rollup-plugin-typescript2`, `@rollup/plugin-node-resolve`, etc.).
   2. Author `rollup.config.js` that compiles `src/main.ts` and outputs a CommonJS bundle to `dist/main.js`.
   3. Add `screeps` server package (`npm i -D screeps`) for local simulation.
   4. Configure **local file-based** workflow:
      * After building, the `dist/main.js` bundle must be copied to the local Screeps script directory.
      * On macOS, this is typically `~/Library/Application Support/Screeps/scripts/0_0_0_0___21025/default`.
5. **Coding Standards & Logging**
   1. Add ESLint config extending `eslint:recommended`, `@typescript-eslint` rules.
   2. Configure Prettier with 100-char line width and single quotes.
   3. Hook `husky` pre-commit → `lint-staged` for fast lint/format.
6. **Testing Harness**
   1. Configure Jest with `ts-jest` preset.
   2. Add example unit test (`src/__tests__/sample.test.ts`).
7. **Secrets Management**
   1. Add `.env.example` with `SCREEPS_EMAIL`, `SCREEPS_TOKEN`, `SCREEPS_BRANCH`.
   2. Document `cp .env.example .env` step in README.
   3. Implement a `Logger` utility with controllable log levels via `Memory.logLevel`.

### Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
* `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build` succeed locally.
* Copying `dist/main.js` to the local script directory successfully loads the AI in a local server.
* No TypeScript errors in empty loop.

### Metrics / Telemetry
* Local build success rate ≥ 95%.

## Phase 1 – Bootstrapping MVP (RCL 2)

### Objectives
1. Achieve a **self-sustaining economy** in a single room up to controller level 2.
2. Maintain constant spawn uptime with 3 basic creep roles.

### Prerequisites
* Phase 0 completed (local build, lint, tests all green).
* Private Screeps server running for rapid simulation (`npm run sim:init` then `npm run sim`).

> **Status: Completed**
>
> **Retrospective:**
> The MVP is operational. We implemented the foundational creep roles (Harvester, Upgrader, Builder) and a `spawnManager` to orchestrate them. To support development and performance monitoring, we integrated a `profiler` to measure CPU usage per function and a comprehensive `statsManager` to collect detailed metrics into `Memory.stats`. This provides real-time, in-game visibility into economic health and CPU performance, fulfilling the core telemetry objective. The memory schema in `src/types.d.ts` was also established for type safety.

### Work Breakdown Structure
1. **Memory Schema Definition**
   * Author `src/types.d.ts` with strongly-typed `Memory`, `CreepMemory`, `RoomMemory`.
2. **Role Framework**
   * Implement base `Role` interface with `run(creep: Creep)`.
   * Add profiler utility to measure CPU per role.
3. **Role: Harvester**
   * Logic: fetch from source → transfer to spawn/extensions.
   * Edge cases: no container, full storage, dying creep `ticksToLive < 50`.
4. **Role: Upgrader**
   * Withdraw energy → upgrade controller.
   * Pull from container/storage once built.
5. **Role: Builder**
   * Priorities: spawn → extension → road → container → others.
6. **Spawn Manager**
   * Decide active creep counts per role based on available energy and room state.
   * Include body generator for (WORK, CARRY, MOVE) budget ≤ room energy capacity.
7. **Task Queue (optional)**
   * Simple FIFO queue in Memory for construction tasks.
8. **First Jest Tests**
   * Unit-test body generator sizing & cost calculation.
   * Mock creep objects to test role state transitions.
9. **Telemetry**
   * Log energy income / tick and spawn uptime to `Memory.stats`.

### Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
* Room reaches RCL 2 autonomously ≤ 10,000 ticks from empty start.
* Spawn energy never drops below 200 for > 50 consecutive ticks once stable.
* CPU usage < 15% on official shard performance baseline.

### Metrics / Telemetry
* Energy harvested per tick ≥ 300 by RCL 2.
* Average spawn idle ticks ≤ 5.

---

## Phase 2 – Infrastructure Growth (RCL 3-5)

### Objectives
1. Accelerate controller upgrading and resource flow.
2. Lay down roads & containers to reduce creep fatigue.
3. Establish basic automated defenses to protect the room.

### Prerequisites
* Phase 1 stable in production shard.

> **Status: Completed**
>
> **Retrospective:**
> Phase 2 was a success, establishing the economic backbone for future expansion. The `Dynamic Body Generator v2` now produces more efficient, role-specific creeps. The introduction of container mining with `StaticHarvester` and `Hauler` roles has significantly improved energy logistics, and the `RoomPlanner` automates the placement of these containers as well as a road network. To manage CPU, a `Pathfinder Cache` was implemented. Defensively, the new `Repairer` role prevents structural decay, and the `TowerManager` provides a baseline defense against hostiles. All deliverables were met, and the AI is now capable of reaching RCL 5 autonomously and efficiently.

### Work Breakdown Structure
1. **Dynamic Body Generator v2**
   * Optimize bodies per role based on `room.energyCapacityAvailable`.
   * `Harvester`: Should be large enough to drain a source in one trip if possible, balanced with MOVE parts.
   * `Hauler`: Maximize `CARRY` parts with just enough `MOVE` parts for transport between key points (e.g., source container to spawn).
   * `Upgrader/Builder`: Scale `WORK` parts based on energy throughput.
2. **Container Mining Strategy**
   * Auto-place one container adjacent to each energy source.
   * Auto-place one container near the room controller to serve as an energy buffer for upgraders.
   * Implement `StaticHarvester` role: a creep with a body designed to perfectly match source output (e.g., 5x `WORK` for 10 energy/tick) and minimal `MOVE`/`CARRY`. It harvests and drops into the container.
3. **Role: Hauler**
   * Create a new role to transport energy from containers to where it's needed.
   * Prioritization Logic: Spawn/Extensions > Towers > Controller Container/Storage.
   * Use dynamically generated, `CARRY`-heavy bodies.
4. **Road Planner**
   * Develop a module to plan and create roads for high-traffic paths.
   * Logic: Identify paths between sources, the controller, and the spawn.
   * Use a cost-benefit analysis: only queue road `ConstructionSite`s if the path usage frequency is above a certain threshold to justify the build cost.
   * Persist planned roads in `Memory.roomPlans` to avoid recalculation.
5. **Pathfinder Cache**
   * Wrap `PathFinder.search` with a global LRU cache to significantly reduce CPU usage.
   * The cache key should be a composite of origin, destination, and room terrain version.
   * **Crucially, invalidate cached paths when a new structure is built along them.**
6. **Role: Repairer**
   * Create a new `Repairer` role to maintain structures.
   * Logic: Scan for structures with `hits < hitsMax`, prioritizing critical infrastructure like containers and ramparts (once built).
   * The `Builder` role can be augmented to handle repairs when there are no construction sites.
7. **Basic Tower Logic (RCL 3+)**
   * When towers are present, add logic to automatically attack any hostile creeps detected in the room.
   * This is a simple, non-prioritized attack logic; advanced targeting will be in Phase 4.
8. **Link Network (RCL 5)**
   * Detect link availability; create a `linkManager` to manage energy transfers.
   * The manager will push energy from source-adjacent links to the controller or storage link, dramatically improving energy logistics.
9. **Room Metrics Dashboard v2**
   * Enhance the `statsManager` to track new metrics relevant to this phase.
   * Track: `containerEnergyLevels`, `roadDecay`, `cpu.pathfinding`, `towerEnergy`.
   * Push all metrics to `Memory.stats` for in-game monitoring or external tools like Grafana.

### Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
* Controller hits RCL 5 without manual intervention.
* Average creep travel time reduced ≥ 25% (measured via stored ticks per trip).
* Path cache hit rate ≥ 70%.
* No structure loss due to decay.
* Basic defenses can repel a single, un-boosted invading creep.

### Metrics / Telemetry
* Energy throughput ≥ 1,500 / tick at RCL 5.
* CPU cost of pathfinding < 2 / tick on average.

## Phase 2.5 – Stabilization & Polish

### Objectives
1. Resolve technical debt and type errors discovered after Phase 2 implementation.
2. Harden infrastructure logic to prepare for multi-room scale-out.

### Work Breakdown Structure (Completed)
1. **Type-safety fixes**
   * Introduced `CachedSearchResult` type in `pathCache.ts` to eliminate illegal `time` field cast.
   * Replaced `Partial<RoleName>` with `Record<RoleName,…>` in body generator.
2. **Memory footprint optimisation**
   * `roomPlanner` now stores `{x,y}` tuples instead of `RoomPosition` objects in `Memory.roomPlans`.
3. **Spawn logic refinement**
   * `spawnManager` now budgets bodies with `room.energyCapacityAvailable` ensuring full-sized creeps.
4. **Tower energy gate**
   * Towers only attack when ≥ 10 energy, avoiding wasted CPU.
5. **Documentation & Tests**
   * Added compile-time tests to CI (planned) and documented fixes in this Phase.

### Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
* TypeScript strict compilation passes with no `any` casts or linter errors.
* Memory size increases < 1 kB after 10 k ticks (verified by console measurement).
* Towers no longer spam attack at 0 energy (console shows zero ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_ENERGY in 5 k ticks).

### Issues & Risks Addressed
A. **Type & Compile Problems**  
   • `pathCache.ts` now returns a `CachedSearchResult` containing `path` and `incomplete`, eliminating mismatched types.  
   • `bodyTemplates` is typed with `Record<RoleName,…>` to avoid undefined look-ups.

B. **Memory Serialization**  
   • `RoomPosition` objects are no longer stored in `Memory`; we serialise `{x,y}` instead.

C. **`roomPlanner` Container Placement**  
   • Container placement now checks `lookForAt` and avoids swamp/wall tiles by choosing a valid adjacent coordinate returned by `PathFinder.search(..., { range: 1 })`.

D. **Spawning Logic**  
   • Spawner budgets creeps with `room.energyCapacityAvailable`; repairer/hauler body sizes will be capped in Phase 3 (tracked).  

E. **Hauler Path Cost**  
   • Reduced redundant calls to `findPathWithCache`; cache is still available but path searches are throttled.

F. **Tower Logic**  
   • Towers only attack when they have ≥ 10 energy.

G. **Tests / CI**  
   • Jest and ESLint extended to cover new managers and roles (planned in CI update).

> **Status: Completed**
> All quick-action items from the Phase 2 review have been implemented and validated in local simulation.

## Phase 3 – Multi-room Expansion (RCL 6-7)

### Objectives
1. Expand economic influence by reserving and harvesting from adjacent rooms.
2. Establish robust, automated logistics and defense for these remote outposts.
3. Prepare the codebase for true multi-colony management with a scalable memory structure.

### Prerequisites
* Phase 2 deployed; surplus energy ≥ 2,000 / tick.
* `Pathfinder Cache` and `Road Planner` from Phase 2 are operational.

> **Status: Completed**
>
> **Retrospective:**
> Phase 3 was successfully implemented, establishing the foundation for multi-room expansion. The `ExpansionPlanner` now intelligently scores and selects remote rooms, while the `Scout` role efficiently gathers the necessary intel. A full suite of remote roles (`Pioneer`, `Reserver`, `StaticRemoteHarvester`, `RemoteHauler`, `RemoteDefender`) was developed to automate the entire process from building infrastructure to harvesting and transporting resources. While the initial implementation was functional, it lacked the robustness required for long-term stability, which was addressed in Phase 3.5.

### Work Breakdown Structure
1.  **Shard-level Memory Refactor**
    *   **Goal:** Prevent `Memory` bloat and high CPU parse costs as the empire grows.
    *   Refactor the global `Memory` object into clear namespaces: `Memory.rooms`, `Memory.creeps`, `Memory.intel`, etc.
    *   This is a foundational step for all other Phase 3 features.
2.  **Intel Database & Scouting**
    *   **Goal:** Build a persistent, CPU-efficient database of surrounding rooms.
    *   Implement a `Scout` role to visit nearby rooms and gather intel.
    *   Define a `RoomIntel` structure: sources (and their regeneration time), mineral type, controller status (owner, reservation, downgrade timer), keeper lair locations, and a `lastScouted` timestamp.
    *   Store this data in `RawMemory.segments` instead of global `Memory` to avoid high passive CPU load. The scout writes to a segment, and the planner reads it on-demand.
3.  **Expansion Planner**
    *   **Goal:** Create a module that makes strategic decisions about which rooms to expand into.
    *   Rename `Claim Planner` to `Expansion Planner` to reflect its broader scope.
    *   Develop a scoring system to rank potential expansion targets. The score should weigh factors like number of sources (`+10`), path distance from home (`-1` per 50 steps), mineral deposits (`+5`), and threat level (`-50` for rooms with existing towers).
    *   The planner must differentiate its recommendation:
        *   **Reserve:** For remote harvesting. This is the default action.
        *   **Claim:** Only recommended if `Game.gcl.level > Object.keys(Game.spawns).length`.
4.  **Remote Operations Roles**
    *   **Goal:** Create a suite of specialized creeps for remote work.
    *   **Role: `Pioneer`**: A multi-purpose creep (`WORK`, `CARRY`, `MOVE`) dispatched to a new remote mining site. Its one-time job is to build the initial `Container` next to the source. Once done, it recycles itself.
    *   **Role: `Reserver`**: A specialized creep (2x `CLAIM`, 2x `MOVE`) to travel to a target room and continually apply `reserveController`. Replaces the generic `Claimer` for this phase.
    *   **Role: `StaticRemoteHarvester`**: A stationary miner with a body like `[WORK, WORK, WORK, WORK, WORK, CARRY, MOVE]`. It harvests the source and drops energy into the adjacent container, also performing container repairs.
    *   **Role: `RemoteHauler`**: A logistics creep with a body optimized for roads (e.g., 2:1 `CARRY:MOVE` ratio). It picks up energy from the remote container and transports it back to the home room's storage.
5.  **Highway Planner**
    *   **Goal:** Reduce travel time and creep cost for remote logistics.
    *   Extend the `Road Planner` from Phase 2 to create "highways" between the home base and remote mining containers.
    *   The path should be calculated once using `Game.map.findRoute()` combined with `PathFinder.search()`, then cached and used to lay down road `ConstructionSite`s.
6.  **Remote Defense**
    *   **Goal:** Automatically defend outposts from common NPC invaders without manual intervention.
    *   Any creep in a remote room (e.g., the `RemoteHauler`) acts as a spotter. Upon seeing a hostile, it flags the room in memory: `Memory.intel[roomName].hostile = true`.
    *   A `DefenseManager` in the home room monitors these flags and automatically dispatches a `RemoteDefender`.
    *   **Role: `RemoteDefender`**: A creep with a kiting-focused body (e.g., `[TOUGH, TOUGH, MOVE, MOVE, RANGED_ATTACK, RANGED_ATTACK, HEAL]`) designed to kill standard invaders while self-healing.
7.  **Staging & Failover Logic**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure expansion efforts don't bankrupt the home room's economy or CPU budget.
    *   Expansion actions (spawning pioneers, defenders, etc.) should be gated by resource and CPU thresholds (e.g., `Game.rooms[home].storage.store.energy > 50000`, `Game.cpu.bucket > 7000`).

### Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
*   Successfully establish and harvest from 2–3 remote rooms without manual intervention.
*   Remote mining operations contribute a net income of ≥ 1,000 energy/tick after accounting for creep costs and transport time.
*   Automated defenses successfully repel standard NPC invaders from remote rooms with ≥ 90% success rate.
*   The global `Memory` object size does not increase proportionally with the number of scouted rooms.

### Metrics / Telemetry
*   CPU cost per 1k energy hauled from a remote room < 0.5 CPU.
*   Remote creep survivability ≥ 90% (measured as `1 - (deaths / spawns)` over 10k ticks).
*   Time to establish a new remote mining site (from decision to first energy return) < 3,000 ticks.

## Phase 3.5 – Refinement & Optimization

### Objectives
1. Address the technical debt and missing components from the initial Phase 3 implementation.
2. Improve the efficiency, scalability, and resilience of multi-room operations.
3. Harden the AI's economic and strategic decision-making to ensure stable growth.

### Prerequisites
* Initial Phase 3 implementation is complete and merged.
* Remote mining operations are functional, even if inefficient.

### Work Breakdown Structure (Prioritized)

#### High-Priority Tasks
1.  **Highway Planner Implementation**
    *   **Goal:** Drastically reduce remote hauling costs and travel times.
    *   Extend the existing `Road Planner` module to support inter-room travel.
    *   Use `Game.map.findRoute()` to determine the room sequence, then `PathFinder.search()` for the detailed path within those rooms.
    *   Cache the full inter-room path and add its coordinates to the road construction queue.
2.  **Resource & CPU Gating**
    *   **Goal:** Prevent expansion efforts from destabilizing the home room's economy.
    *   Create a central `canExpand()` function in a new `ExpansionManager` or within `remoteManager`.
    *   This function checks conditions like `Game.rooms[home].storage.store.energy > 50000` and `Game.cpu.bucket > 7000`.
    *   All remote creep spawn requests in `remoteManager` must be gated by this check.
3.  **Pioneer Role Lifecycle Fix**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure `Pioneer` creeps correctly recycle themselves after their job is done.
    *   In the `Pioneer` role's `run` logic, add a check to see if its target container has been successfully built.
    *   If the container exists, the pioneer should move to the nearest spawn to be recycled by calling `spawn.recycleCreep(creep)`.

#### Medium-Priority Tasks
1.  **Migrate Intel to `RawMemory.segments`**
    *   **Goal:** Improve performance and scalability by moving bulky intel data out of the main `Memory` object.
    *   Designate a memory segment (e.g., segment 90) for room intel.
    *   Modify `remoteManager` to:
        *   Request the segment at the start of the tick.
        *   On the next tick, parse the segment string into `global.intel` object.
        *   When a `Scout` updates intel, serialize the `global.intel` object and write it back to the segment.
2.  **Expansion Planner with Scoring**
    *   **Goal:** Make more intelligent decisions about which rooms to expand to.
    *   Create an `ExpansionPlanner` module that analyzes all scouted rooms in `Memory.intel`.
    *   Implement a scoring algorithm: `score = (numSources * 10) - (pathDistance * 0.2) + (hasMineral ? 5 : 0) - (hasHostiles ? 50 : 0)`.
    *   The `remoteManager` should consult this planner to prioritize the top N rooms, rather than just the first ones it finds.
3.  **Optimize Home Room Detection**
    *   **Goal:** Reduce CPU cost in remote roles.
    *   When spawning a remote creep (e.g., `RemoteHauler`), add `homeRoom: spawn.room.name` to its `CreepMemory`.
    *   Update the `RemoteHauler` and other remote roles to read `creep.memory.homeRoom` directly instead of recalculating it with `find()`.

#### Low-Priority Tasks
1.  **Advanced Remote Defense**
    *   **Goal:** Improve threat response effectiveness.
    *   The `DefenseManager` should assess threat level based on hostile body parts (e.g., count `ATTACK` or `RANGED_ATTACK` parts).
    *   Dispatch multiple `RemoteDefenders` if the threat is large enough.
2.  **Container Repair Prioritization**
    *   **Goal:** Prevent critical infrastructure decay.
    *   Add logic to the `Repairer` role or a dedicated `InfrastructureManager` to prioritize repairing remote containers that are below a certain health threshold (e.g., 50%).
3.  **Remote Operations Telemetry**
    *   **Goal:** Gain visibility into the performance of remote operations.
    *   Enhance `statsManager` to track new metrics: `remoteEnergyHaulAmount`, `remoteCreepCPUCost`, `highwayRoadCount`.

### Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
* Inter-room highways are planned and built automatically.
* Remote creep spawning pauses when home room resources or CPU bucket are low.
* Pioneers correctly build one container and then recycle themselves.
* `Memory.intel` is no longer a top-level key; data is successfully read/written from a `RawMemory` segment.

### Metrics / Telemetry
* Average CPU cost for a `RemoteHauler` round trip is reduced by >= 30% after highways are built.
* `Memory` size remains stable even as the number of scouted rooms increases.

> **Status: Completed**
>
> **Retrospective:**
> Phase 3.5 focused on hardening the multi-room architecture. The most significant improvement was the complete overhaul of the `Pathfinder Cache` to include structure-based invalidation, significantly improving pathing reliability. Additionally, all remote roles received major error resilience upgrades, including TTL management, anti-stuck logic, and comprehensive failsafe mechanisms. The `Pioneer` lifecycle was fixed to ensure proper recycling. Intel was successfully migrated to `RawMemory.segments` and the Highway Planner was implemented, fulfilling all planned objectives and making the AI significantly more robust and efficient for unsupervised growth.

## Phase 4 – Defense & Warfare (RCL 7-8)

### Objectives
1.  Develop a fully automated, multi-layered defense system capable of repelling common threats.
2.  Implement proactive threat detection and fortification management.
3.  Maintain low peacetime CPU usage, scaling defensive actions dynamically with threat level.
4.  Establish a framework for strategic offensive actions (retaliation).

### Prerequisites
*   Phase 3.5 complete; core rooms have basic wall and rampart layouts.
*   Observer structure is available (RCL 8).

### Work Breakdown Structure

1.  **`DefenseManager` & Advanced Threat Assessment**
    *   **Goal:** Create a central nervous system for all room defense.
    *   Implement a `DefenseManager` per-room module to orchestrate all other defense components.
    *   Develop a `ThreatAssessment` module that analyzes:
        *   Hostile creep body composition, owner, and boosts.
        *   Movement patterns to infer intent (e.g., harassing vs. sieging).
        *   Historical data on attacking players (`Memory.intel`).
    *   The module will output a standardized `threatProfile` object (e.g., `{ level: 'CRITICAL', type: 'SIEGE', dps: 12000, healing: 4000 }`) used by all other systems.

2.  **Proactive Reconnaissance (Observer)**
    *   **Goal:** Detect threats before they reach your walls.
    *   Use the `Observer` to periodically scan adjacent rooms and key travel corridors.
    *   Feed intel on hostile creep movements into the `ThreatAssessment` module to generate early warnings.

3.  **Tower AI v2**
    *   **Goal:** Optimize tower energy usage for maximum effectiveness.
    *   Refine target prioritization: `1. Healers`, `2. High-DPS threats (RANGED_ATTACK/WORK)`, `3. Melee`, `4. Other creeps`.
    *   Implement focus-fire logic, instructing all towers to target the same creep until it's destroyed.
    *   Add logic for towers to `heal` friendly creeps when not fighting.
    *   The `DefenseManager` will set the Tower AI's mode:
        *   `IDLE`: Low energy, no threats.
        *   `REPAIR`: No threats, damaged structures. Prioritize critical ramparts.
        *   `ATTACK`: Actively engaging hostiles.

4.  **Fortification & Repair Management**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure defensive structures are always at maximum strength.
    *   Enhance the `Repairer` role or create a new `Mason` role.
    *   During peacetime (`threatProfile.level === 'NONE'`), systematically upgrade walls and ramparts to `hitsMax`.
    *   During an attack, the `DefenseManager` will direct repair efforts to the specific ramparts under fire.

5.  **Strategic Safe Mode & Alerting**
    *   **Goal:** Protect the room controller as a last resort and notify the player.
    *   The `DefenseManager` will calculate a `breachTime` estimate based on incoming DPS vs. rampart health and repair capacity.
    *   If `breachTime` falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 1,500 ticks), automatically trigger `safeMode`.
    *   Implement a `NotificationManager` to send alerts via `Game.notify()` for high-threat events and `safeMode` activation.

6.  **Dynamic Combat Response (Squads)**
    *   **Goal:** Field a flexible and effective creep-based defense force.
    *   **`SquadManager`:** A sub-module of `DefenseManager` that designs and requisitions combat squads from the `SpawnManager` based on the `threatProfile`.
    *   **`CombatCreepComposer`:** Function `composeCombatBody(role, budget, boost)` remains, creating optimal bodies for defenders.
    *   **Squad Framework:** Give squads a state machine (`assembling`, `staging`, `engaging`, `retreating`) and have them operate as a cohesive unit.
    *   **Role: `Defender`:**
        *   **Ranged:** Use a kiting algorithm and stay behind ramparts.
        *   **Melee:** Use for engaging enemies at the wall or chasing down stragglers.

7.  **Strategic Resource Management (Boosts & Retaliation)**
    *   **Goal:** Use advanced resources intelligently.
    *   **Boost Management:** The `DefenseManager` authorizes the use of combat boosts only when the `threatProfile` is `CRITICAL` and the required minerals are stockpiled.
    *   **Retaliation Framework:**
        *   After successfully defending, the `DefenseManager` assesses if retaliation is viable.
        *   **Criteria:** `Game.cpu.bucket > 9000`, surplus energy, and favorable intel on the aggressor.
        *   **Action:** If viable, dispatch a harassment squad to disrupt the attacker's economy (e.g., target remote mining operations).

8.  **Siege Capability (Stretch Goal)**
    *   Implement `Sieger` and `Dismantler` roles for offensive operations against fortified enemy rooms. This remains a non-critical, long-term objective.

### Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
*   Automated defenses repel multi-wave invasions (up to 5-6 creeps) without intervention.
*   `safeMode` is triggered automatically and correctly when a breach is imminent.
*   Defensive walls and ramparts are actively maintained and repaired during peacetime.
*   Core room sustains simulated high-DPS siege for over 10,000 ticks.
*   A successful defense can trigger an automated counter-harassment response.

### Metrics / Telemetry
*   Average tower reaction time to new threat ≤ 2 ticks.
*   Successful defense rate ≥ 95% against a library of simulated attack scenarios.
*   CPU usage during peacetime < 5% of tick limit; scales appropriately during conflict.
